# Brick breaking game
## A game where you have to try to break all the bricks.
**Instructions:**
Movement, use A for left and D for right or turn on mouse mode in the settings to move with your mouse.
Press M to open the settings.
**There is no multiplayer yet.**

**There is a chance that the MacOS ARM 64 app won't work. If it doesn't, use the .jar file instead**
The program I am using ([Packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr)) to make native launchers for .jar files doesn't support MacOS ARM 64 and only supports x86_64. I have compiled Packr from source to get the latest version as there is a commit named "macOS on M1". I have also added the aarch64 JRE to the MacOS ARM 64 app.
